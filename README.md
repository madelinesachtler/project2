# Project 2 


## EXTRACT 
We collected our data from kaggle.com and decided that it was easiest to collect datasets with a common column name. 
We found three datasets that all included information about food, happiness and GDP all connected by the Country name. 
We downloaded the csv files and imported them into Pandas, and subsquently formatted them into separate dataframes. 


## Transform 
A substantial amount of data cleaning was requried in order to create a dataframe that was worth keeping with interesting information.
